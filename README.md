Game Rules
The rules of the Pig Dice Game are as follows:

Each turn, a player rolls a die.
If the player rolls a 1, their turn ends, and they score no points for that turn.
If the player rolls any other number (2-6), the number is added to their round score.
The player can choose to hold, which adds their round score to their total score, ending their turn.
The first player to reach or exceed a target score (default: 100) wins the game.

High Scores

The Pig Dice Game tracks and displays high scores for both PvP and PvC modes. You can view the top ten high scores for each mode from the main menu.
