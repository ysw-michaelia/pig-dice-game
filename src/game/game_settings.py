"""
This module contains the GameSettings class.

It is responsible for setting up the game configurations for a dice game.
This includes configuring games against the computer with varying difficulties
or setting up a game between two players.

Classes:
    GameSettings: Handles the configuration and setup of game settings based on
    user input, including the mode (player vs computer or player vs player),
    the difficulty level of the computer opponent, and obtaining player names.
